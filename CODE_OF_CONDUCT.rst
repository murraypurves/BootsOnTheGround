Contributor Code of Conduct
===========================

1. Be **kind**.
2. Don't take **yourself** too seriously.
3. Don't take **others** too seriously.
4. Make all discussion about **the code** and not the author(s).

This should be **fun**! Do not hesitate to **contact** 
me (william.wieselquist@gmail.com) to help **protect** that.

*If you need something more explicit, please see the latest version 
of the Contributor Covenant at http://contributor-covenant.org.*
